Currently taking a break from this project to work on my other Liar's Dice project
When will I revisit this? Not really sure lol but I'm okay with it, it was good practice

**TODO:**
- create the menu bar
- add images for ingredients/drinks (too lazy)
- add a backend to checkout menu
- improve the CSS and responsive behaviour
